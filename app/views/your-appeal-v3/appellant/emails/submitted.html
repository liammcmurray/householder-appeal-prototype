<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">What happens next?​</h2>

<p>We need to make sure your appeal is valid, which means checking it includes all the necessary documents.​</p>

<p>This should take around 2 weeks but may take longer in busy periods.​</p>


<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	<li>Once we confirm we have everything we need, we'll start your appeal.​</li>
	<li>Your local planning department will then submit their evidence. This usually takes around 1 week after you submit your appeal. ​</li>
	<li>An inspector may need to make a site visit. ​</li>
	<li>The Inspector will then consider all the evidence to make their decision.</li>
</ul>
​<p>We will contact you at each of these stages.​</p>
